# Instacart Market Basket Analysis - Kaggle Competition

[Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/) is an online grocery shopping service.

This machine learning competition is to challenge teams or individuals to develop models that can be used to accurately predict what Instacart customers will buy next using the data of past customer orders.

The end goal is to submit predictions for the test set using a well-trained machine learning model, and achieve the highest F-score possible.
